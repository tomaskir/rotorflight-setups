# Status
Fully flyable under all conditions and manuevers.

# Issues remaining
- Gov is not yet fully tuned.
- Small tail disturbances / jumps when jabbing cyclic / collective, likely related to gov and precomps. Nothing bad, but it is visible.
- Small shakes on tictok stops. Likely too much I on cyclic.
- Roll to pitch coupling. Likely just needs some coupling adjustment.
